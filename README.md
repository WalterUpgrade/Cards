# React + Vite
# Slider

Buttons are now visually disabled. I added a new CSS rule targeting .prev:disabled:hover and .next:disabled:hover to change the background color when hovering over a disabled button. This adjustment provides a clear visual indicator that the button is inactive and not clickable.
